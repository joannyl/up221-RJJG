## Research Question
Vision Zero is Los Angeles's commitment to eliminate traffic deaths by 2025. The project began by looking at traffic collision data in Los Angeles between 2009-2013 and through this data, the LA Department of Transportation designed the High Injury Network (HIN), a visualization of streets with a high concentration of traffic collisions that result in severe injuries and deaths. Vision Zero is a plan put forward by LADOT to update current roads, intersections, and pedestrian infrastructure along this High Injury Network to prevent fatal traffic collisions. Our research question is focused on analyzing the effectiveness of Vision Zero and tracking their progress to eliminating traffic deaths by 2025. 
## Why it Matters 
As Urban Planning students, we are interested in designing safer cities. We are attempting to measure the effectiveness of Vision Zero in LA. We will be looking at traffic accidents before and after the implementation of Vision Zero initiatives, to understand if there has been any increase or decrease in traffic accidents in specified corridors. 
## Spatial Scope
We will select a sampling of the top 5 street corridors in LA that have the highest fatalities prior to Vision Zero implementation (pre 2015) compared to accident rates as of 2022 (pending available datasets). 
## Data Sources
+ Updated 2018 Report of Vision Data Project with updated data sets (PDF report, not a map data set): https://ladotlivablestreets-cms.org/uploads/d704aa3913e440d5ab4cb91930e902d4.pdf
+ The first one "Top 60 Priority Intersections" includes all the intersections that have been prioritized for the development of safety projects in Los Angeles: https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/ladot::top-60-priority-intersections/about
+ LAPD Traffic Accidents from 2010 to present: https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Traffic-Collision-Data-from-2010-to-Present/d5tf-ez2w
## Scope 
We want to map out the top 5 accident corridors in LA, and then show the number of traffic accidents on a map of those corridors before the implementation of Vision Zero, and traffic accidents on those corridors after. It would be great if we could have a slider that allows for a user to view accidents year over year, to see if accidents increased or decreased when Vision Zero tactics were implemented. This should allow a user to see if Vision Zero was effective at reducing traffic accidents on those targeted corridors. 
Visualizations of project implementations, before and after (added protected pedestrian crosswalks, etc)
## Conclusion
Besides measuring the general effectiveness of Vision Zero in eliminating traffic deaths, we also hope to learn more about the demographics of high accident concentration areas. We hope to learn more about patterns and outliers that exist and can contribute to continue making streets safer for Angelenos.
