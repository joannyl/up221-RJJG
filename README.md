# Speaker notes for Midterm Presentation

### Slide 2: 

Vision Zero originated in Sweden in the 1990’s, as the belief that traffic deaths are preventable, and society must work to prevent fatal and severe crashes. Vision Zero aims to eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries, while increasing safe, healthy, equitable mobility for all.

LA adopted its own Vision Zero commitment with its 10 year plan to eliminate traffic deaths by 2025. Every year, an estimated 700 people are killed while trying to move throughout LA County. Nearly half the people killed in traffic crashes were walking or bicycling, and many of those killed are children and older adults.

We will examine the locations where fatal and injury-causing traffic accidents occur most frequently, and also seek to understand if LA is on track to reduce fatalities down to zero. 

### Slide 3

Even though pedestrians account for only 8% of all traffic collisions, pedestrians make up 44% of all deaths in traffic accidents, making them a highly vulnerable group.

### Slide 4 

Our objective is to:
- See how successful Vision Zero has been so far
- Current state of the program
- Analyze the infrastructure updates and see the effectiveness

### Slide 5

Looking at the 2019 Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System report for LA County, we found that we are losing between 500 to 800 people a year to traffic fatalities, and between 50,000 to 65,000 people a year get injured or disabled by traffic accidents.
We shouldn’t simply accept that cars kill and maim as a cost of doing business. For those who have lost a loved one, this is devastating, and for those injured, their lives are changed in an instant.

### Slide 6

The report also shows which cities have the highest rates of fatalities from cars accidents, and from cars striking down pedestrians. The City of LA ranks highest in total number of people killed by car accidents, followed by Long Beach / Compton, Palmdale / Lancaster, and unincorporated. As we mentioned earlier, young children and seniors are disproportionately victims of car crashes.

### Slide 7

Regarding injury rates, the cities that rank highest include the City of LA, followed by unincorporated areas of LA, Long Beach, Palmdale / Lancaster. Pedestrians injured by cars are high in these areas as well, but Glendale, Santa Monica, and Pomona also rank high. These areas might be more walkable, but are still dangerous for walkers.
