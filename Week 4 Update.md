# Mini Group Assignment
### Project Title: Success of Vision Zero 
### **Roles & Titles:** 

+ **Genevieve Chacon:**  Focused on gathering updated accident data in Los Angeles and visually presenting the data through maps and charts. I can also look at accident data and policy intiatives in other U.S. cities like NYC or Houson to compare to Los Angeles.
+ **Jessica Lopez:** Right now, as we have initiated our interest in measuring the effectiveness of Vision zero, I am interested in researching the spatial variables that will help us tell a story.
+ **Joanny Leyva:** Demographic data collection and analysis - Responsible for finding data on the demographics of communities next to the top 5 accident corridors and producing graphics that help understand the data. 
+ **Rebecca Saavedra Swint:** Lit review collection: Finding existing literature and maps on the project

### **Research Question:**
Based on feedback, we are reforumlating our question to "Is LA on track to eliminate traffic deaths by 2025 through Vision Zero?" 

### **Status Update:** 
The team is all still working to learn how to code, which is challenging. It’s been difficult to find time to work together since we all have pretty full schedules, but we’re doing our best. We should probably set aside a recurring time to work together, and make some time to attend office hours with the TA’s. We received Christopher’s feedback and plan to incorporate it into our project, especially the focus on top 5 accident corridors. 

### **Data Update:**
We still need to identify the top 5 accident corridors, and we need to provide descriptive statistics about the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the communities next to the top 5 accident corridors. Per Christopher, he suggested that we should show who is impacted by traffic collisions, because it may also point to planning injustices that can be addressed by advocating for the design of safer cities. 

+ Christopher provided this data source, that we need to look into. Locations of crashes are in section 8 of the report: [SWITRS Data](https://tims.berkeley.edu/tools/query/) 
+ LADOT High Injury Network: [Data](https://ladotlivablestreets.org/news/HIN-update)
+ Updated 2018 Report of Vision Data Project with updated data sets: [PDF report, not a map data set](https://ladotlivablestreets-cms.org/uploads/d704aa3913e440d5ab4cb91930e902d4.pdf)
+ The first report, "Top 60 Priority Intersections," includes all the intersections that have been prioritized for the development of safety projects in Los Angeles: [Report](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/ladot::top-60-priority-intersections/about)
+ LAPD Traffic Accidents from 2010 to present: [Report](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Traffic-Collision-Data-from-2010-to-Present/d5tf-ez2w)

### **Concerns:**
**Major Concerns** 
+ We need to identify the top 5 corridors. Need to look into the available data and just find where these are. Then we need to find shapefiles for these areas. 
+ Uncertain if we will be able to find the data we need. We might need to adjust our research question. 
+ Learning how to code the data is a challenge. We have an idea of what we want to show, but it is to be determined if we can learn how to code accordingly. We may make time to work with the TA’s for this. 

**Minor Concerns:**
+ Finishing our work by the deadlines.
